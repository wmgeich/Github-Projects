<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
Lady DiscoStep was born in New York City, but moved to L.A. when she was 15, where she started making music. She played guitar throughout high school, and played with the art rock band, "Whoshow" for 2 years. During this time, she also start experimenting with creating ambient electronic music and dubstep on her Mac computer.

After living in Berlin and Rome for a year after high school and playing with a variety of pick up groups there, Lady DiscoStep returned to L.A. heavily influenced by the music of Europe's dance clubs and Euro disco. She began developing her own style, which she dubbed discostep, by mixing her love of ambient electronic with dance music. Like dubstep, discostep is heavily instrumental, with occasional vocal samples, moderate beat-tempo and heavy syncopation.

Lady DiscoStep loves performing live and has played over 700 concerts in her career.  She also loves creating music mixes for her friends, who inevitably share those mixes with the world. She appears regularly as a guest D.J. in clubs around L.A. and San Francisco, and can otherwise be found on the beach with her dog, Zappa.
